# ECC - an application created as part of an master's thesis.

A desktop application created in Python, than presents elliptic curves in cryptography.
Program can generate elliptic curves and do mathematical operations on them. 
Another posibility is to encrypt points on elliptic curves using ElGamal algorithm. Program can also generate a digital signature using ECDSA.
